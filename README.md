# Weekly Expense Tracker App 📊

Welcome to the Weekly Expense Tracker app developed by Wout Deleu and Elian Vantomme as a school project for KU Leuven's Mobile Application course! 📱

## Project Overview 🚀

As students who understand the importance of managing a weekly budget, we realized that keeping track of expenses can be challenging. To make your life easier, we've designed this app to help you stay on top of your weekly spending.

With this app, you can:
- Add expenses easily.
- Record your bills and divide them into categories.

Whether you're a student or anyone looking to manage their finances, this app provides a simple and efficient way to track your weekly expenditures.
